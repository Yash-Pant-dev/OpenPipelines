I can go the extremely well engineered route
# Do i need a database?
env - name, location, checksum (needed when uploading envs for others to use), pipelines
pipeline        
sources - intermediate sources distributed throughout the nodes, cant keep it in db?

# build the ui first so that i know what i need? also useful for sketching out everything.
